== Completion

The following completions are available in JBang. If they do not open up automatically then do an explicit completion using kbd:[Alt+Space] or kbd:[^+Space] dependent on your platform.

=== Basic directive completion

Completion for JBang directives like `//JAVA` and  `//DEPS` are available at start of comments (`//`).

=== Dependency completion

`//DEPS` has completion of Maven artifacts using JBang/Gradle syntax. You can use fully qualified names or just type a substring of the Group and artifact version to get a list of possible matches from Maven Central.
